I Am A Student And I Fill Alot Of Form

(Input Tag) So If You Reduce Your Time

I Mean Do you want to save your mind?

I am not promoting anyone. I am a student, this is where I am

You may also want some details of the form to be filled in automatically so you can use **AUTO FILL** which is a web component i.e. extension

You can save all the details in it and you can also give them short-cut keys.```
